#  Markdown-msplanner 

Microsoft is probably already working on this as a default feature....but for now here is a chrome extension to add markdown to Microsoft Planner's Note section. This is still in development so pull requests welcome.

Chrome store extension will be linked here soon.

## How to use in Chrome/Edge-Chromium

Download this <a href ="https://github.com/MattHeffNT/markdown-msplanner/archive/master.zip" download>file</a> as a zip
Unzip the folder
Visit chrome://extensions (via omnibox or menu -> Tools -> Extensions). Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button. Select the folder you just unzipped (where you downloaded the file).

To learn how to use markdown here is a cheatsheet: <a href ="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">Markdown Cheatsheet</a>

## For Devs

For Devs: Clone the repo to your desktop and then npm install will install the respective dependencies. Use NPM Run Watch or NPM Run Build and then select the project folder and add to chrome as an unpacked extension.
