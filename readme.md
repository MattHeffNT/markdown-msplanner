#  markdown-msplanner 

Microsoft is probably already working on this as a default feature....but for now here is a chrome extension to add markdown to Microsoft Planner's Note section. This is still in development so pull requests welcome.

## Installing

Clone the repo to your desktop and then npm install will install the respective dependencies.
